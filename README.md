👤 About Me
I am a motivated Computer Science student with a strong interest in web development, software systems, AI-based solutions, and real-world academic projects. I enjoy transforming ideas into practical implementations through hands-on development.
I have worked on a wide range of projects including management systems, educational platforms, AI assistants, automation tools, portfolio websites, and experimental hardware concepts. My main focus is on building simple, scalable, and student-friendly solutions.
I primarily specialize in frontend development, while also having a good understanding of system logic, project architecture, data handling, and basic backend concepts. I strongly believe in continuous learning, discipline, and improving skills through real project work.
